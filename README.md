Question   1 (35 points)
You will build a strategic asset allocation consistent with your risk profile.   Each   of   you will be assigned a risk profile.
Find your assigned level of   risk tolerance from the following table:   your risk tolerance   is   assigned based on your first name.Risk Tolerance LevelStudent whose first name begins with the   following letters.Very lowA, B,   C, D,   E,   F,   GLowH,   I, J,   K,   LModerateM,N, O, P,   Q, RHighS, T, U,   V,   W,   XVery highY, Z
You are required to use this risk profile and assets from the Capital   Market   Assumptions   given in Appendix   1 to create your strategic   asset   allocation.
You have been assigned an investor profile that describes your risk tolerance. You must answer the following questions based on the risk tolerance level assigned to you.   Risk   tolerance   is   defined   in   terms   of   the   maximum   acceptable   loss   (maximum   drawdown)   ofyour portfolio you are comfortable with, as shown   in   Table   1.
Table   1: Risk toleranceRisk ToleranceMaximum acceptable lossVery low10%Low15%Moderate25%High30%Very high40%
A fund manager has provided you with five different defensive/growth asset   combinations related to five different levels of   risk: Conservative, Moderate, Balanced,   Growth   and   High   Growth. The portfolios are constructed from the inputs from   Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs): asset class long-term return and risk assumptions   in Appendix   1.
Table 2: SAA for different   investor profiles

a)       Based on your allocated risk tolerance from Table   1, choose the   portfolio   that   fits
your assigned risk profile. To calculate the maximum drawdown of   a portfolio, use this   rule   of   thumb: Maximum   drawdown   = 3xVolatility. The   volatility   of   the   portfolios is provided in Table 3. Please mention your risk tolerance level when   you   answer this question. Explain why you selected this portfolio (i.e. how the   chosen   portfolio is consistent with your risk profile and others are not).             (4 points)
b)      Use these CMAs in Appendix   1 and Carver’s method to create   your   own   SAA   instead   of   using manager’s   SAA. Follow these rules while creating your portfolio.
i)                         Keep the cash   allocation   as   it   is   in   the portfolio   suggested by your   manager.
ii)                      Keep the total allocation to   Equity, Alternatives   and   Fixed   Income   as   they   are   in   the   portfolio   suggested   by   your   manager. For   example, if   you   selected   the   conservative portfolio, your allocation to Equity, Alternatives, and Fixed Income   should be kept at   14%,   11%   and 40%, respectively.
iii)                   Use   Carver’s   method   to   allocate   for   allocation   withinEquity,   Alternatives   and
Fixed Income. For example, if   you selected the Conservative portfolio in part   (a) then   14% of   your portfolio should be allocated between AU Equity, DM ex-AU      equity and EM equity using Carver’s method. And will do the same   for Alternatives and Fixed Income   assets.




iv)                   There   are   several   ways   to   distribute   your   portfolio   withinEquity   and   Fixed
income using Carver’s method. For example, you can allocate within   equity using   the method i) one-step approach: AU Equity, DM ex-AU Equity   and   EM   Equity         in one step or method ii) top-down approach: DM   or   EM   in   the   first   step   and   then   AU Equity, DM ex-AU equity   and EM equity in the   second   step.   Similarly,   you can allocate within fixed income using the one-step or top-down approach.
Please show the SAA using either method i) the   one-step   approach   or ii) the   top-   down approach. Explain why you prefer the method you used. (2   points)
You need to show the details of   the steps and   formulas   and how   you   work   out   the   allocations   of   your   SAA. If   you   use   Excel, please   also   provide   the   template   with   formulas and show a screenshot of   your Excel worksheet   in   your   submitted   answer   workbook.    (9 points)
c)       Compare   the   expected   rate   of   returns   of   the   portfolios   suggested   by   your   investment manager and the one you created. Which one would you prefer?   Why?      (4 points)
d)      From the table below, estimate the Sharpe Ratio of   the portfolio created by Carver’s method and your investment manager. Which portfolio would you choose? Explain your selection. Use your estimates from the previous question for portfolio returns   in      columns   (2) and   (5) of   Table   3 (You   need   to   do   this   exercise   only   for   代 写BEX3131 - ASSIGNMENTC/C++

Table 3: Performance of   the portfolios


e)      Will you change your allocation if   you have twice the amount   of   wealth   you have now?         (2 points)
f)       Suppose you are 45 years   old.   How   would   your portfolio   strategy   change   if   you   were   instead a recent university graduate   just starting to invest? Would you   adjust your portfolio? If   yes, how   and   why? If   no, why   not?   (2 points)
g)      Suppose you are 45 years old. How would your portfolio strategy   change   if   you   were   nearing   retirement? Would   you   modify   your   portfolio? If   yes, how   and   why? If   no, why not?    (2 points)


h)      What   adjustments   would   you   make   to   your   portfolio   if   inflation   were   significantly higher than its long-term average? Why?   (2 points)
i)       How   would   you   rebalance   your   portfolio   in   response   to   market   volatility   exceeding your assigned maximum drawdown?   (2 points)
j)       How might behavioural biases, such   as   loss   aversion   or   overconfidence,   influence your portfolio decisions during a significant drawdown?      (2 points)

Question 3 (15   points)
Students will assume the role of   a financial advisor and recommend investment   options   to   a   client assigned to you. The age of   your client and   their risk tolerance   are based   on   the following table:Age of   your client   and   risk   toleranceStudents whose last name begins with the   following letters20, LowA,   B20, ModerateC, D,   E20, HighF,   G28, LowH,   I, J,   K28, HighL40, ModerateM, N, O,   P40, HighQ,R,   S, T55, HighU, V, W, X, Y, Z
Background
Suppose you are a financial advisor. You have a   PhD   in   finance,   specialising   in investments, and are familiar with all the complexities of   advanced   investment   strategies.   Through   twenty   years   of   practical   experience   working   with   clients, however, you   have concluded   that   simple   heuristics   work   best   most   of   the   time.
One such heuristic you rely upon is the client’s age as the   starting point   for the percentage   invested in defensive assets as the basis for   choosing   an   investment   option   for   a   client   saving for retirement.   So, a 25-year-old client would be advised to invest   in   an   option with   at least 25% in   defensive   assets.
You   then   adjust   this   percentage   upward   to   Age   minus   ten   if   the   client   is   more   tolerant   of risk and increase it by ten per cent if   the client is   less tolerant.
Your clients are considering Hostplus and Unisuper. Read the Member Guide   from   HostplusandUnisuper(also attached) to answer the following questions.
a)      Which of   the   Core options would you recommend from Hostplus?   Why?   (2 points)
b)      Which   of   the   pre-mixed   options   would   you   recommend   from   Unisuper? Why?   (2   points)
c)      You want to evaluate the options you recommended for your client   from   a)   and b).
Based   on   past   performance, which   one   of   these   two   options   would   you   choose?   Explain your recommendation. (5 points)
d)      Your client has reviewed the recommendation from part a) and requested you
recommend a strategy with exposure to socially sustainable investing   from Hostplus. Given your heuristic-based process for recommending options, is there a   suitable sustainable investment diversified option? If   not, what   should you   recommend? Explain your answer. (3 points)
e)      Your client has also considered Hostplus Life option because he/she is not   actively   engaged with the super and doesn’t often switch   investment   options   as   age   grows.      Will you recommend the Hostplus Life option? Explain your answer.   (3 points)
